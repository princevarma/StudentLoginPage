A Django Project consists of four major Python files within the 
project tree namely settings.py, views.py, urls.py, models.py

The settings file deals with all the Django project settings at 
system level , the urls file stores all the URL patterns for our 
project that stem out and redirect from our main page. We store 
our data models in Python Django format in the models file which 
is then translated into SQLite operations by default in the process 
without any explicit need to code. Finally the views file is where 
the request and response functions are handled and the page 
serving is done.

We make use of something called a virtual environment to make our 
project locally sustainable without bloating the main Python 
installation and encapsulate it.
